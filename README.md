🔹 PROJECT NAME
Image Recognition System using Python & Flask

1. WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
This is a web-based application that can:
📸 Take an image
🧠 Analyze it using Artificial Intelligence (AI)
🏷️ Identify what object is present in the image

Example:
If you upload an image of a cat, it will predict "Cat"
If you upload a dog, it predicts "Dog"
This is called Image Recognition.
